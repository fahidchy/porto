        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi! I am Fahid Hossain Khan Chowdhury. I am currently studying Master of information Technology at King's Own Institute. I have worked
            as as a Web Developer at Medlab Clinical where my main objective was to
            improve their web application using Laravel at the back end and HTML/CSS at the front end. I have also
            worked at Livelo where I learned and used React and Node.js to improve their website. I possess excellent
            problem solving and analytical skills which have assisted me greatly in my studies and work. </p>
